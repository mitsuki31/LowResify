# LowResify

Looking for an image enlarger or upscaler?
Sorry, this isn’t the place. Instead, this tool is made to compress — or more accurately, pixelate — your images in the simplest way possible.

No need for advanced editing skills or heavy photo software. Just drag and drop your photo, and **LowResify** will do the rest.

## Origin

Honestly, I don’t know how else to put it — pixelated memes inspired me to create this weird little project.
